# Function Examples

This is the home of all the public examples of Shopify Functions. Any of the sample apps can be used with the CLI as an [app template](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools#app-templates) by passing `--template https://github.com/Shopify/function-examples/sample-apps/<sample-app-name>` to the [app creation command](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create#step-1-create-a-new-app).

## Local Development

If you wish to run the samples directly from this repository, you must first expand any `.liquid` templates with the following command.

```shell
yarn
yarn expand-liquid
```
